# Hi there, I'm Wonyeong Choi(ByHRG)

I enjoy building tools that solve real-world problems, especially in e-commerce and data analysis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Web & Markup**: HTML, CSS, Jinja2

- **Databases**: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools**: httpx, mitmproxy, Frida, PyInstaller, uv, Git, PyCharm
- **Others**: REST API, Web Crawling, Reverse Engineering, CLI Automation

## 🚀 Personal Projects

Here are some things I've been working on recently:

- 🛒 **E-commerce automation** – Scripts and bots to automate product availability checks, carting, and purchases from various online stores
- 🕵️ **Web scraping** – High-performance crawlers using `httpx`, `Playwright`, and headless browsers for real-time data collection
- 🔐 **API reverse engineering** – Digging into hidden APIs and encrypted traffic to uncover undocumented endpoints
- 📊 **Data parsing and normalization** – Product metadata extraction with unit conversion, quantity parsing, and structured storage
- 🧩 **[Pv10Stock](http://pv10stock.서버.한국/)** / **[PvStock (Private Repo)](https://github.com/ByHRG/PvStock)**  
  A FastAPI-based web app for tracking online and offline product inventory across multiple fashion and sneaker retailers.  
  Utilizes `httpx` and custom parsers to fetch and display stock status in real-time.  
  Features include cart automation, unit-aware product parsing and a responsive UI with Jinja2 templates.  
  The server runs on an unused **Galaxy Z Flip 3** via **Termux**, exposed to the public using **ngrok** — a cost-efficient and portable deployment setup.
